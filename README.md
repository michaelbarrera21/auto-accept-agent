# Auto Accept for Antigravity

## Run 3 AI agents in parallel. Zero babysitting.

Stop watching tabs. Auto Accept keeps every Antigravity conversation moving — accepting file edits, terminal commands, and recovery prompts automatically.

## Why Auto Accept?

Antigravity's multi-agent workflow is powerful, but it stops every time the agent needs approval. 

**That's dozens of interruptions per hour.**

Auto Accept eliminates the wait:
- ✅ **File edits** — Auto-applied
- ✅ **Terminal commands** — Auto-executed
- ✅ **Retry prompts** — Auto-confirmed
- ✅ **Stuck agents** — Auto-recovered

---

## Features

### Background Mode (Pro)
Run multiple Antigravity tabs simultaneously. Every conversation auto-accepts in the background — no tab-switching required.

### Dangerous Command Blocking
Built-in protection against destructive commands like `rm -rf /`. Pro users can customize the blocklist.

### Real-time Status Overlay
Visual indicators show conversation state:
- **Purple** — In progress, actively polling
- **Green** — Task completed

### Works Everywhere
- ✅ Antigravity
- ✅ Cursor
- ✅ Multiple windows
- ✅ Minimized/unfocused
- ✅ Multi-instance (Smart Port Detection)

## Quick Start

1. **Install** the extension
2. **Click** `Auto Accept: OFF` in the status bar
3. **Allow** the one-time shortcut update if prompted
4. **Done** — Auto Accept activates automatically

The extension runs silently. Check the status bar for `Auto Accept: ON`.
